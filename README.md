## Hi there 👋


I am **flo** ~kusnp~, a student of applied mathematics.👨🏻‍🔬

Currently working in a company as data analyst, the primar objectiv is to let the _"elder"_ know how to use ***Python*** and save money 💸 and time ⏲ doing so. 

My ***bachelor's degree*** 👨🏻‍🎓 currently requires me to create, deploy, and compare physiological and machine learning-based models in ***Python***.

I am sort of an advanced intermediate beginner I guess😉. Likewise, I am now coding for about two Years.

**For many more years to come!**

## 🎇💻 **Happy Coding** 👾🎨
